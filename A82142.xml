            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Under theſe ſad ſufferings of the people of God, our ſouls mourned: and underſtanding by the manifold gracious promiſes in the Word of God, that a time of deliverance was to be expected to the Church of Chriſt, and deſtruction and ruine to <hi>Babylon;</hi> Our hearts, together with all truly godly in <hi>England,</hi> were exceedingly ſtirred up to pray to the Lord, even day &amp; night, that he would ariſe to deſtroy Antichriſt, and to ſave his People: Whileſt this Spirit of Prayer was poured forth upon Gods people in <hi>England,</hi> attempts are made upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> to bring them to a conformity in religious worſhip, by endeavouring to impoſe upoe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119025:2"/>them a Popiſh Service-Book, which was through the great goodneſs of God, by his people in <hi>Scotland,</hi> reſerted; which made the wrath of the late King and His Prelates, wax ſo hot againſt them, ſo as <hi>Scotland</hi> had no other way to preſerve it ſelf, but by coming into <hi>England</hi> with an Army; which the godly in <hi>England</hi> did not then count an Invaſion to deſtroy <hi>England,</hi> no more then they do this our preſent march for the ruine of <hi>Scotland</hi> but rejoyced to ſee ſome appearing againſt that Antichriſtian power that had perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Saints, and were aſſured, That the Lord was come forth to anſwer the many Prayers and Tears that were then poured and pouring forth for that purpoſe; and therefore ſo far as we have any opportunity farthered the deſigns of that Army, ſome of us haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding our lives by ſpreading their Book, intituled, <hi>The</hi> Scots <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and pleading for the juſtneſs of their Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us remember how the Lord was pleaſed graciouſly to anſwer the prayers of his people at that time, in their Deliverance from the Army raiſed by the late King, and his Prelates, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all the people of God in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, That ſoon after <hi>Scotland</hi> ſits in Peace, enjoying their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberties, without being impoſed upon by the Antichriſtian Prelacy in <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>England</hi> obtains a Parliament, to whom they have opportunity to complain of their grievances, and through the great goodneſs of God ſo conſtituted, that grievances are heard, and overtures made to the late King for their redreſs: which was ſo irkſome to His Oppreſſing, Tyrannical and Bloudy ſpirit, that he again betook himſelf to overthrow the Parliament by force, and to that end entertains the Officers of the Army that had gone forth againſt our Brethren of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and withdrawing himſelf from his Parliament, an appearance of a Civil War begins; which being made known to us, the inferior Officers and Souldiers of this Army (then in our Private Callings) we found our hearts extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſtirred up by the Lord, to aſſiſt the Parliament againſt the King; being abundantly ſatisfied in our judgements and conſciences, that we were called forth by the Lord, to be inſtrumental to bring about that, which was our continual prayer to God <hi>(viz.)</hi> The deſtruction of Antichriſt, and the Deliverance of his Church and people. And upon this ſimple accompt we engaged, not knowing the deep policies of worldly Stateſmen, and have ever ſince hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our lives in the high places of the field (where we have ſeen the wonders of the Lord) againſt all the oppoſers of this work
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119025:2"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, whom we have all along ſeen going with us, and making our way plain before us. And having theſe things ſingly in our eye, namely, the deſtruction of Antichriſt, the advancement of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, the Deliverance and Reformation of his Church, in the Eſtabliſhment of his Ordinances amongſt them in purity according to his Word, &amp; the juſt civi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Liberties of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: We did many of us rejoyce at the Covenant, becauſe we found in it a ſtrain towards theſe ends, although ſome being more enlightened, did apprehend it to be ſo mixt with worldly intereſt, that they juſtly feared the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt would be only pretended to, and the Intereſts of this world, yea, of Antichriſt himſelf carried under a vizard, as we have ſince had abundant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of; which hath made us (we confeſſe) not to idolize the Covenant (as we fear too many do) though we truſt it will appear before God, Angels and Men, that we ſhall ever purſue its true and Lawful ends, according to the plain and candid meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; though we do not upon every occaſion urge the Covenant, (as we ſee every party, though as far d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But when we ſaw that under pretence of the Covenant, a corrupt party in Parliament, by their worldly policy, after the war was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> and the lare Kings party ſubdued, with the loſſe of Thouſands of the lives of Saints (whoſe death is precious in the ſight of the Lord) did endeavour to ſet up the King upon his own terms, and with him to eſtabliſh a National Church-Government, not in all things agreeable to the Word of God, but it deſtructive to the juſt Liberties of the True Spiritual Church of Chriſt, which he hath by his own moſt precious bloud purchaſed for them, and is now come forth to beſtow upon them: which did ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And being witneſſes to ſo much of the innocent bloud of the Saints that he had ſhed in ſupporting the Beaſt; and conſidering the loud cries of the ſouls of the Saints under the Altar, we were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily carried forth to deſire Juſtice upon the King, that man of bloud: And to that purpoſe petitioned our Superiour Officers, and the Parliament, to bring him to Juſtice: which accordingly, by an high hand of Providence was brought to paſs; which Act we are confident the Lord will own, in preſerving the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> againſt all Kingdoms and Nations, that ſhall adventure to meddle with them upon that account: When God executes his judgements upon Malefactors, let none go about to reſiſt: When he brings forth thoſe his enemies that will not ſuffer Jeſus Chriſt to be King in the midſt of his Saints, and breaks them in pieces like a Potters veſſel; let not <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor any other Nation ſay, What doſt thou?

               </gap> ſervants of men, we have not onely proclaimed Jeſus Chriſt, the King of Saints, to be our King
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119025:4"/>by Profeſſion; but deſire to ſubmit to him upon his own terms, and to admit him to the exerciſe of his Royal Authority in our hearts, and to follow him whitherſoever he goeth, he having of his own good will entred into a Covenant of Grace with his poor Saints; and be aſſured, it is he that leadeth us into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as he hath done in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And therefore we do in the ſpirit of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, and of the fear of the Lord, beſeech you to look about you; for our Lord Jeſus is coming amongſt you as a refiners fire, and as Fullers ſope: and bleſſed are thoſe in whom the leaſt dram of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity ſhall be found.</p>
            <p>We have a Paper directed to us from the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it having been publikely made known to us at the head of our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; wherein we are firſt deſired to conſider the lawfulneſs of our marching into <hi>Scotland.</hi> We bleſs God, we did that before we came; and are abundantly ſatisfied, that we are brought hither by the Lord: nay, many of us lying under temptations of fleſh and bloud, and going about to frame excuſes to take us from this march, found, that to have ſtaid behinde, had been to have turned our backs upon Jeſus Chriſt, and to have deprived our ſelves of much ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, that now through his goodneſs we do enjoy.</p>
            <p>We have alſo conſidered the Arguments, by which you go about to weaken the grounds of the Parliaments, and our Superiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, leading us into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and muſt needs give you this return: That we are ſtill abundantly eſtabliſhed in this belief, that what the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> hath done in ſending us into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath been of abſolute Neceſſity to preſerve themſelves from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in their Religion and Liberties, which they have been at ſo much coſt both of Bloud and Treaſure, to purchaſe and preſerve: and therefore by the way we muſt needs tell you, that we cannot endure to hear them called <hi>A pretended Parliament;</hi> which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to take notice of, that if you write to us again, you would ſpeak more reverently of the Authority of our Nation, or elſe we ſhall eaſily think you will upon every occaſion be ready to invade <hi>England,</hi> that you may ſet up an Authority, which you may call lawful.</p>
            <p>And let us, as in the preſence of the Lord, further aſſure you, That we have already examined our conſciences, as before the Lord, and have a clear aſſurance in our hearts, That he will countenance us in this action, and that we do not break any Covenant which we have ſworn before God, Angels and Men; but could be contented
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119025:4"/>ſhould we not thereby Idolize the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to march to any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with you, if called thereunto by the Lord, with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> on the tops of our Pikes; and let the Lord judge who hath obſerved the Ends of the <hi>Covenant</hi> beſt, you or we? Yet we do acknowledge, VVe have not been the exact Performers, though not the wilful breakers thereof: Our conſciences alſo bear us record, VVe do above any thing in the world, deſire the Union of the two Nations; and it is our prayer daily, That thoſe that fear the Lord in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> may become one in the hand of the Lord, and joyn together in the advancement of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, and throwing down, and trampling upon the Seat of the Beaſt. VVhy ſhould not <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> rejoyce to ſee the Horns of the Beaſt cut off, that we may joyn together, to hate the VVhore, and to <hi>burn her fleſh with fire?</hi> The Lord is our witneſſe (whom we fear) we come not to oppreſſe you, or ſhed your blood; we have cryed to the Lord, again and again, to prevent it: we have ſent you our Declarations of Love to the People of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which ſome amongſt you, though they pretended to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yet do moſt injuriouſly and unchriſtianly keep from their ſight, nay, moſt falſly miſ-repreſenting us as a people come with intentions to deſtroy the poor inhabitants, and that we are left of our God to be deſtroyed: but we have made our prayer to the Lord, and made known before him their ſayings, who hath told the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That God hath forſaken us; and therefore bid them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and take us, for now the Sectaries day is come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Lord is ſtill with us, he is our Refuge, and a preſent help in trouble, ready to be found: we do believe, the cry of the oppreſſed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will be heard, and wo be to thoſe that are the Cauſe thereof. Our Quarrel is ſtill againſt Malignants, the Root whereof is now, through the evil Policy of ſome States-men, become the Head of <hi>Scotland.</hi> We dare not quarrel with thoſe whoſe hearts are upright with Jeſus Chriſt, and faithful and loving to <hi>England,</hi> but with thoſe who are moſt treacherous and falſe to both; and therefore we dare not any of us, though tempted thereto by your papers, be ſo carnally wiſe, as to deſert the Cauſe and Work of Jeſus Chriſt, in which we have hitherto been ſo long and ſo miraculouſly carried on. Do you think we are men ſo weakly principled, as to be perſwaded without the leaſt ſtrength of Argument to deſert the Intereſt of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expoſe thouſands of the precious Saints of Jeſus Chriſt, to be trampled upon as the dirt in the ſtreets, when the Lord is about
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119025:5"/>to put on their beautiful garments, and to make them a praiſe in the earth? Or can we (think you) betray our ſuperiour Officers, in whom we ſee ſo much of the ſweet Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, into your hands, whoſe mouths are opened wide to devour them? we pray you not to wait for ſuch a thing. The Lord hath brought us hither by his Providence, and upon him we ſhall with confidence depend, till we ſee a glorious iſſue, which we humbly and heartily deſire may be without the effuſion of any more blood; and (if it be the will of God) both ſpeedy and comfortable to you and us, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with joy into <hi>England,</hi> and leave <hi>Scotland</hi> rejoycing that an Engliſh Army hath been amongſt them: which poſſibly may be the ſooner effected, were you and we ſuffered to confer, and open our hearts one to another: We do believe much of the bitterneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would be allayed in our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did they know how exceedingly we are ſlandered by the pens and tongues of many of your Kirk-men, concerning our Religion and faith towards God, which though we may not vainly boaſt of, yet according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles direction, we are ready to give an anſwer to the meaneſt Chriſtian in <hi>Scotland, that ſhall ask a Reaſon of the Faith and Hope that is in us, with meekneſs and fear.</hi> And indeed, we account our beſt way of contending with thoſe ſlanders, is to pray the Lord to make our hearts ſound in his ſtatutes, that we be not aſhamed, that ſo we <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Lord God in our hearts, and having a good conſcience, they that ſpeak evil of us as of evil doers, may be aſhamed whileſt they falſly accuſe our good converſation in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have we in the naked plainneſs of our ſouls opened our hearts unto you our dear Brethren that fear the Lord in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where ever you be found, whether in the higheſt Councils or the pooreſt Cottages, who though you now be ſcattered, the Lord will in his due time bring you together, and bind you up as his Jewels, and make you one with thoſe that fear the Lord amongſt us: which the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in him our God and Father alſo, bring to paſs in his due time; and in the mean time make both you and us wiſe to underſtand the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the exalting of Chriſts Kigdom: That in all our undertakings we may be ſubſervient to the Affairs of Jeſus Chriſt, and above all things take heed how we ſtir up any of the powers or ſtrength of this world to deſtroy one another. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, be with you.</hi> AMEN.</p>
